fuck dude. this is not minor. and would be a good Experimental Geography project. could do it then instead.

damn it. is the midi sequencer a better project?

this is what happens when you punt on the original proposal. or make it too vast.

the issue is the public sphere as a subject. this project is not about the public sphere. it's individual, because it's about feedback.

none of my art list works are really public sphere. kind of because Im getting out of that. stressful.

shit. ok, so bloodcam is perfect and really fucking awesome. but doesnt really work.

you could actually develop a rhythm database. maybe you just need to sit in space. you should do that sunday.

theres always SMS. and text interfaces.

could make an iphone app for recording rhythms, or gestures, on the keypad. speed is intensity, so you could have continuous motion, or just taps.

could we do this with javascript?

also log the distance, and the 'size'/intensity

can think about those parameters

that only works for short timescales. what if you are tracking multiple overlapping rhythms? rhythms have long cycles.

turns out an area is hard to track in terms of rhythm, unless youre going to do it with serious data collection, which is my whole thing anyway, room audio processing, cosm. Almanac as form requires _data_.

bleh.

but not true. sitting and doing rhythmanalyses are nice. that simple act. producing scores. would that be enough?

/

hmm. is this really all that much more public sphere?

to force footfalls into public sphere, could geolocate. then you listen to someone elses footfalls as you walk their route...
that gets really tricky interface wise.

this almost works. it just doesnt feel clever.

/

in conclusion: 
- do a hail-mary request to the actual dudes about the blood thing
- could do a simple meditation sit, if you can find a nice documentation form thereof.
- could cast footfalls. and then do a lot of work.

liz - weird shit
nupur - rad public art
ari - theater thing
liat - public performance
jen - bike deal
elisa - 

so everyone is doing public space, though only nupur has something really transformative.
