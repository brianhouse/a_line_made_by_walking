        <h3>(an experiment in data, control, aural empathy, and time-shifted masses by <a href="http://brianhouse.net" target="_blank">brian house</a>)</h3>
        This is a webapp for iOS. Using your iPhone's accelerometer, it will record the cadence of your footsteps as you walk from Bowery to Broadway on Great Jones street. While you walk, you will hear a click track of the footsteps made by someone else who walked before you. Try and match them. After you're done, your walk will guide someone else. And so on and so forth.

        Footfollow will be active starting Saturday, April 20th.
