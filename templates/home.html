        This is a webapp for iOS. Using your iPhone's accelerometer, it will record the cadence of your footsteps as you walk. Additionally, you will hear a click track of the footsteps made by someone else who walked before you. Try and match them. Or don't. After you're done, your walk will guide someone else. And so on and so forth.
