        This is a webapp for iOS. Using your iPhone's accelerometer, it will record the cadence of your footsteps as you walk from Bowery to Broadway on Great Jones street. While you walk, you will hear a click track that matches the footsteps made by someone else who walked before you. After you're done, your walk will guide someone else. And so on and so forth.
