ok, so each walk is:
5*60 / 10 = 30 gps points

that's fine. we can load everything and plot it.

circle icons on map, with lines extending out
click on the circle, loads up the walk
what if there are overlapping walks?

can have a manual click


//

- marker zooming
- browser sanity check -- needs to be ios safari
- big question is generalizing the gait detection.
- specialized issues: timeouts cease to work when phone sleeps
    if the phone is clicked off, does that kill the timeout?
- set max walk time (5 min)
- should have a 'ding' for starting
