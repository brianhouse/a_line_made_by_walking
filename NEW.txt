ok.

- welcome, description
- device set up: sound, sleep, pocket
- route information
- route map, with start activation
- ready screen
- walking
- done

who do they follow?
well, me. that way it will always work.

but then we dont get feedback.

config option for which one to choose.




//

- need management functions (delete walks)
- marker zooming
- browser sanity check -- needs to be ios safari
- big question is generalizing the gait detection.
- specialized issues: timeouts cease to work when phone sleeps
    if the phone is clicked off, does that kill the timeout?
- set max walk time (5 min)
- should have a 'ding' for starting

hmm. but what we might actually want here is to produce a sound mass.

if I can get enough people to do the same walk, could do a xenakis thing.

use geo to start and stop it.

famous nyc walks?
something with wallstreet?
distributed march on ...
time-shifed march on ...

because then we can get to talking about masses
