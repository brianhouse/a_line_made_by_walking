ok, so each walk is:
5*60 / 10 = 30 gps points

that's fine. we can load everything and plot it.

what if there are overlapping walks?
can have a manual click


//

- need management functions (delete walks)
- marker zooming
- browser sanity check -- needs to be ios safari
- big question is generalizing the gait detection.
- specialized issues: timeouts cease to work when phone sleeps
    if the phone is clicked off, does that kill the timeout?
- set max walk time (5 min)
- should have a 'ding' for starting

hmm. but what we might actually want here is to produce a sound mass.

if I can get enough people to do the same walk, could do a xenakis thing.

use geo to start and stop it.

famous nyc walks?
something with wallstreet?
distributed march on ...
time-shifed march on ...

because then we can get to talking about masses
