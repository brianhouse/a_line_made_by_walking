ok, not bad. so there are still some sp/ml issues that could improve with process. some learning. but can press forward.

each time it runs, it goes into crashdb. which is great.

process then runs, extracts footstep onset information. adds an addendum to the file. throws it out if it isnt good enough. makes a second crashdb file.

should be able to list the walks in crashdb in the user interface.

on selection, there is playback.

not bad.

///

make the activate sound zero volume
have the sounds pan
need to log the GPS coordinates and real start time




///////

conceptual justifications:

- being in someone else's shoes, enforces a rhythm
- data feedback: this happens on a media and society scale, meaning in demonstrating locally
- constrained in public space


for testing, simultaneously record audio for ground truth





///

        // function loadSound () {
        //     console.log("Loading sound...");
        //     $.ajax({
        //         type: 'GET',
        //         url: 'snd.wav', 
        //         dataType: 'arraybuffer',    // not implemented in jquery!
        //         success: function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
        //             console.log("Success: " + textStatus);
        //             context.decodeAudioData(data, null);
        //         },
        //         error: function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
        //             console.log("Failed: " + textStatus);
        //         }
        //     });
        // }

for presentation:

make a presentation outline, with talking points

add gps, make sure we have real start time

need several real walks
show the signal processing charts
make some overlayed walk charts

points:
- also doing the video analysis, a bit stalled. almanac needs a larger effort, going to make it a class unit.
- needed to bang something out here
- mention previous attempts, show the arduino, apologize for all the technical work
- relate it to the almanac (is it one aspect?)
- being in someone else's shoes, enforces a rhythm
- data feedback: this happens on a media and society scale, meaning in demonstrating locally
- constrained in public space
- could be distributed as an app
