data collection shield -- assembly. compatible with my arduino?


so the accelerometers can wire directly into the arduino. need some code for the data collection.

constraining to a route is one thing. could even play back a day's worth.

this is not a minor project.


have to somehow log the precise start time of starting walking, and somehow that maps to the start time of the audio playback.

in theory you could do this with one accelerometer.

in theory you could do this, including playback, with iOS.


what would be more useful to me? getting hip to iOS? or arduino? arduino seems more fun.

does arduino even have a realtime clock? doesnt matter. just need relative time since the first footfall.

ok. so I have something that might be working.

needed:

- two accelerometers, hooked up and integrated.
- making sound
